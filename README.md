A - Odd or Even
Do you know how to tell if a number is Odd or Even? You are given T numbers, and for each of those numbers, you have to tell whether the number is odd or even.
Input:
The first line will contain a single integer T(1≤T≤100). Each of the next T lines will contain a number N(-10^5 ≤N≤ 10^5).
Output:
For each N, you have to print whether the number is odd or even. Please see the sample input-output format to know what exactly you have to print.
