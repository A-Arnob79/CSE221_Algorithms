A - Odd or Even
Do you know how to tell if a number is Odd or Even? You are given T numbers, and for each of those numbers, you have to tell whether the number is odd or even.
Input:
The first line will contain a single integer T(1≤T≤100). Each of the next T lines will contain a number N(-10^5 ≤N≤ 10^5).
Output:
For each N, you have to print whether the number is odd or even. Please see the sample input-output format to know what exactly you have to print.

Examples:
Input:                             Output:
5                                  5 is an Odd number.
10                                 10 is an Even number.
19                                 19 is an Odd number.
7                                  7  is an Odd number.
3                                  3 is an Odd number.
100                                100 is an Even number.





B - Can you solve Arithmetic Expressions? 
Can you solve arithmetic expressions with your programming knowledge? Let's find it out. You will be given some arithmetic expressions, and you have to solve them.
Input:
The first line will contain a number T(1≤T≤1000) representing the number of test cases. Then for each test case, you will be given an arithmetic expression. Please see the sample input below. It is guaranteed that the numbers inside the arithmetic expression will be between 1 and 1000.
Output
For each test case, you have to print the result. Look at the sample output for reference.

Important Note: Your answer might contain floating point numbers, and in that case, your answer doesn't have to be exactly equal to the actual answer. For example, if your answer is 20.250000001 and the judge's solution is 20.25, your answer will still be considered correct. As long as it is really close to the correct solution, your solution will be considered correct. Formally speaking, if your solution is x, and the judge's solution is y, then as long as ∣x−y∣≤10^−6, your solution will be correct. In the above example, your solution was 20.250000001 and the judge's solution was 20.25. If you take the difference of these two numbers,  they are smaller than 10^−6. Similarly, if the judge's solution is 19.0000000000 and your solution is 19, it is still correct, as the difference is 0, which is less than 10^−6.
Examples:
Input:
15
calculate 67 + 41
calculate 85 / 5
calculate 13 - 56
calculate 99 - 95
calculate 3 / 10
calculate 12 * 19
calculate 14 - 6
calculate 3 * 88
calculate 45 * 68
calculate 81 - 0
calculate 77 + 40
calculate 8 * 84
calculate 73 - 22
calculate 85 - 86
calculate 28 * 58
Output:
108.000000
17.000000
-43.000000
4.000000
0.300000
228.000000

C - Array Reverse 
You are given an array of N integers. Your task is to reverse the array and print the last K integers from the reversed array.
Input:
The first line contains two integers N(1≤N≤10^6) and K(1≤K≤N) — the number of elements in the array and the value K.
The second line contains N integers separated by spaces a1,a2,a3…an (1 ≤ai ≤10^6) — the elements of the array.
Output:
Print K space separated integers as described in the statement.
Examples:
Input1:
5 3
5 6 7 8 9
Output1:
7 6 5 
Input2:
8 5
20 8 9 3 10 7 100 12
Output2:
10 3 9 8 20
